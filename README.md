# College-Management-System

The main objective of this web-portal project is to automate all functionalities of a college department. Handling data of Students, Faculties and Courses sometimes becomes cumbersome if is managed by account people only. To make these operations easy we have demonstrated a database system for storing information and the authenticated user can view and update their details.
